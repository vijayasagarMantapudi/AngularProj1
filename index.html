<b>The Ask</b>
<ol>
<li> Add a new field to the model called author
<li> Add a new field to the model called file size
<li> Add a new field to the model called creation date
<li> Make the column headings clickable and clicking them should cycle
through sorting by ascending, descending and no order
<li> Add a search row below the heading row, each column contains a search
field. Entering a value in the search field should filter data only based on
values in that column (unlike the search above the table which filters
based on data in any field)
<li> Add another action next to the pencil icon on each row to delete the
record
</ol>
You must attempt one of the following two. For experienced developers interested in senior positions, both are required.

<li> Add a cart area and provide the ability to drag and drop the libraries
into this cart. The cart should display each library as a cart item with
name and file size. Below the cart, the total file size should be
displayed
<li> Integrate with any charting/visualization library and present the data
either based on creation date or file size. Any other visualizations are
welcome
